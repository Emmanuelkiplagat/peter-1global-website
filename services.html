                <h3>Mkulima Young</h3>
                <p>(MY) or “Young Farmer” in English, is a successful agricultural online ICT platform in Kenya and East Africa, with over 130,000 social media followers and around 20,000 registered users. The MY platform provides digital agricultural marketing and advisory services to small-scale farmers and links consumers interested in supporting local farmers.

                    It aims to attract young people back into the business of farming, by improving their earning potential.
                    
                    Since  Mkulima Young started featuring champion farmers, an appreciable change in young people’s attitudes towards agriculture has been noticed. By having Mkulima Young Champions who are educated and young, the attitude of the youth towards agriculture has changed: from viewing it as an activity for the old, to a profession where they can accrue millions of shillings.
                    
                    Notably, it is not only the jobless who are turning to farming, and the initiative is about far more than publicity. Using radio, SMS and social media, young Kenyans are engaged to discuss agricultural topics and listeners to radio programmes can give feedback online, helping to shape the content and making it more relevant.</p>
