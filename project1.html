            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>This e-commerce platform was developed for a leading retailer. It features a user-friendly interface, secure payment processing, and a robust inventory management system.</p>
            <p>Ecommerce, also known as electronic commerce, refers to the buying and selling of products or services online. You can complete an eCommerce transaction using any device that connects to the internet (computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.), and you can buy almost anything: clothing, music, stocks, plane tickets, medicine, and more.  

                Ecommerce has helped online businesses reach a bigger market by providing affordable and efficient sales channels for their products and services. Corporations, independent freelancers, small businesses have all benefited from eCommerce, as have the customers worldwide who are now able to purchase from them 
                
                Advantages:
                
                It’s easier for sellers to reach new customers. Online sellers can build a store on their own website or sell on marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, or Etsy for their eCommerce transactions. Sellers are no longer limited to retailing to local customers; eCommerce makes it possible for them to reach customers around the world.
                Lower barriers to entry. Since business owners don’t need a physical storefront, they can start stores without high overhead costs like rent or staff.
                Convenience. Ecommerce transactions can happen 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can offer unlimited customer support using an AI chatbot and engage with shoppers even when you’re not physically present. 
                Greater product offerings. Ecommerce store owners are not limited by physical retail space, so they can offer a broader range of products. 
                Disadvantages: 
                
                Customers can’t touch products. Customers may want to try on clothes or shoes before buying them. But when buying online, they are limited to the information on your product page to get “hands-on” with your items.  
                Shipping times. When a shopper buys something in your store, they’ll have to wait for it to arrive at their home or office. Companies like Amazon have made it less painful by offering two-day shipping, but most online stores have to charge customers for expedited shipping, which can decrease people’s willingness to purchase. 
                What are the three types of eCommerce?
                Ecommerce comes in many forms. Here’s an overview of the three most common types.
                
                Business-to-business (B2B) eCommerce
                What it is: B2B eCommerce refers to online transactions between businesses. While businesses in this area are predominantly service providers, you’ll also find office supply companies, software companies, manufacturing companies, and more under this category.  
                
                Benefits: With eCommerce, B2B firms can increase their reach to customers and make their products more discoverable than with traditional B2B sales. It also reduces overhead costs to help grow their bottom line. Ordering is more reliable and efficient; you can manage suppliers and customers all in one place; sales no longer need to take place at trade shows. Finally, automated upsell and cross-selling abilities help B2B firms sell more with less.
                
                Platforms: The best platforms for conducting B2B eCommerce are Shopify Plus, BigCommerce, and Oracle SuiteCommerce. 
                
                Business-to-Consumer (B2C) eCommerce
                What it is: B2C eCommerce happens when individuals purchase products or services from online stores. The global B2C eCommerce market size was valued at $3.35 trillion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.9% until 2027. 
                
                Benefits: Convenience is a major benefit and growth driver for the online shopping industry. Merchants can create an online store in a few hours, while customers can find their desired products by visiting a website online using their laptop or mobile device from the comfort of their homes. 
                
                Platforms: The best platforms for conducting B2C eCommerce are Shopify, Wix eCommerce, and WooCommerce. 
                
                Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) eCommerce
                What it is: C2C is an eCommerce model that allows private individuals to buy and sell products from each other online. Advertising methods include free classified advertisements, auctions, forums, and individual pages for startup businesses. 
                
                Benefits: Since C2C eCommerce is more friendly and personable, sellers are often more accessible. Buyers don’t need to contact support for pricing or product questions; they can ask the seller directly. It also tends to require less effort to complete a purchase and can be faster to fulfill on order if the buyer is local. There’s no middleman, and anyone can sell without a business license or certification.
                
                Platforms: The top C2C eCommerce platforms are eBay, Etsy, Facebook Marketplace, and Kickstarter. 
                
                Ecommerce industry growth
                Ecommerce is thriving worldwide. In 2019, an estimated 1.92 billion people bought goods or services online. In the same year, global eCommerce sales worldwide reached $3.5 trillion, and according to Statista’s latest forecasts, e-retail sales will hit $6.5 trillion by 2023. 
                
                Here are some additional interesting eCommerce growth stats:
                
                By 2040, around 95% of all purchases are expected to be conducted online. (Nasdaq)
                As of 2020, online marketplaces (like Amazon and eBay) account for the largest share of global online purchases. (Statista) 
                Amazon leads the worldwide rankings for online retail traffic, having brought in over 5.2 billion unique visitors in June 2020 alone. (Statista)
                The United Parcel Service benefited from the pandemic-fueled surge in eCommerce, enjoying a 65% increase in deliveries to residences and a 13% jump in revenue during the June 2020 quarter. (Wall Street Journal)
                Smartphones accounted for 60%of all retail website visits globally in 2019. (Statista)

                How to start an eCommerce business
                It’s pretty clear that eCommerce is here to stay. But building an eCommerce business is challenging and requires strategic steps and decisions to bring it all together. 
                
                That’s why we’ve compiled a step-by-step list to overcome the barriers you’ll face when starting a successful online store.
                
                1. Brainstorm what problems will your products solve
                The first step to launching your eCommerce business is to think about what solutions you’ll provide. 
                
                Think about:
                
                Why you want to create this product
                Who you plan to sell it to
                What problem it will solve
                How profitable the niche is
                Create buyer personas with this information. Use these customer profiles to understand who you’re selling to and continually refine your target audience. You can use this data to create relevant messaging and ads after you launch your store. 
                
                Aim to create niche products and can’t be found in giant marketplaces. Rhiannon Taylor, owner of RT1Home, tells us how “The pandemic has shown consumers that they can order anything and everything online. Most will prefer the convenience even after retail stores reopen to the public.” 
                
                “It’ll always be hard to compete with big box stores on free shipping, cheaper pricing, and product selection. But there will always be a need for unique, high-end products that consumers want outside of Amazon and Target.” </p>
