        <p>Hello everyone, I am Manu. Today I will be speaking on agriculture and its contribution to our lives. I would like to make this an inspiring speech for farmers who work day in and day out tirelessly to provide food for us. They form the primary sector of our countryâ€™s economy and the crops that they grow serve as the raw materials for many other industries. In fact, the sector of agriculture contributes a good 70 percent to the GDP of our country.


            Since, India has a tropical climate, diverse topography, and water bodies surrounding it, the climatic conditions are favorable for growing quite a good number of crops. India is a major producer of crops like rice, wheat, coffee, pulses, spices, etc. Some parts of India are suitable for growing food crops whereas others are suitable for cash crops. The common methods of farming practiced in India are intensive subsistence farming, plantation farming, mixed farming, terrace farming, dry farming, and crop rotation.
            
            
            The main requirements for cultivating a crop include optimum temperature, suitable soil quality, and proper irrigation. Nowadays, there are several advanced methods of irrigation that have reduced the dependency on rains for agriculture. Many farmers are being educated on the techniques of farming that are effective as well as eco-friendly. Hence our farmers are now able to adopt efficacious methods of farming to enhance the crop quality as well as the amount of yield. To top it all, the advanced methods of farming, such as, organic farming, greenhouse farming, etc. are sustainable in nature. Thereby, even a greater yield does not affect the quality of crops and natural resources. Several development plans for the farmers of our country have been implemented by our government. Many campaigns to support our farmers are conducted by the NGOs to rekindle their hope for a better tomorrow. Hereby, concluding this inspirational speech for farmers, I pledge to support our farmers in any possible ways and spread awareness on the significance of agriculture among the youth.</p>
